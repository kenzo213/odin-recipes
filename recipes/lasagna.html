<p>Chinese Food</p>
<p>Our grandfather was a preacher, so when we were growing up, the whole family would often join the community for all-day church singing and dinner on the grounds. There was almost always a table covered with food, including bowls of coleslaw. Each one tasted different, because every cook used their own special ingredient. This is ours, and it is full of colorsâ€”purple and green and red. It's got everything!</p>

<p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>1 medium head red cabbage, chopped (10 cups)</li>
    <li>1 medium green bell pepper, seeded and chopped (1 cup)</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, chopped (1 cup)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Steps</b></p>
<ol>
   <li>
    Combine cabbage, green pepper, and onion in a large bowl. In a small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, vinegar, powdered sugar, salt, and black pepper until smooth. Pour dressing over vegetables, tossing well to combine. Cover and chill at least 2 hours to allow everything to marinate.
   </li> 
   <li>
    When ready to serve, gently stir in tomato and season to taste with additional salt and pepper. (Chill, covered, up to 5 days.
   </li>
</ol>
