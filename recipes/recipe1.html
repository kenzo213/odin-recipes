    <p>Ingredient Chili</p>
<p>Our grandfather was a preacher, so when we were growing up, the whole family would often join the community for all-day church singing and dinner on the grounds. There was almost always a table covered with food, including bowls of coleslaw. Each one tasted different, because every cook used their own special ingredient. This is ours, and it is full of colorsâ€”purple and green and red. It's got everything!</p>

<p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>15 ounces tomato sauce</li>
    <li>1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, drained</li>
    <li>1 (15 ounce) can chili beans, not drained</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Steps</b></p>
<ol>
   <li>
    Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef  in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.
   </li> 
   <li>
    Stir in kidney beans, chili beans, and tomato sauce. Bring to a boil and stir in chili powder. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
