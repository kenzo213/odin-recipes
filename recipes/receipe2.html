    <p><strong> Hamburger Rice Casserole</strong></p>
<p>Our grandfather was a preacher, so when we were growing up, the whole family would often join the community for all-day church singing and dinner on the grounds. There was almost always a table covered with food, including bowls of coleslaw. Each one tasted different, because every cook used their own special ingredient. This is ours, and it is full of colors—purple and green and red. It's got everything!</p>

<p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup</li>
    <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice</li>
    <li>½ cup long grain white rice</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Steps</b></p>
<ol>
   <li>
    Crumble the ground beef into a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until evenly browned. Drain off grease, and stir in the cream of mushroom soup, tomatoes, and uncooked rice. Cover, and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until rice is cooked, about 15 minutes.
   </li> 
   <li>
    Preheat the oven's broiler. When the rice is done cooking, transfer the contents of the skillet to a casserole dish. Cover with a layer of cheese.
